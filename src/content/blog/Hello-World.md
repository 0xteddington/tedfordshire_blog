This is my first blog and I thought that I would start to give back to the information technology community some of my experiences and knowledge.

I have also begun a journey into the world of Cyber Security/Information Security and I plan to share my journey with the inter-webs!

Iâ€™m not saying I am an all-knowing deity by any means (in fact far from it), simply sharing things I have learned through experience.

Anyway enough rambling for now, stay tuned for future posts.
